# 100DaysOfCode
Journal of my 100 days of code
So far I've been tracking my '100 days of code' on twitter, but have decided to do so on here too so that I can delve into more detail!
I'm already up to day 17 (my favourite number!) so will continue from there onwards...

Day 17

Today I returned to the hackathon from Day 9 at school of code.
We used an API to retrieve trivia questions, and create a simple quiz.
