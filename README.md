# 100DaysOfCode  
Journal of my 100 days of code  
  
So far I've been tracking my '100 days of code' on twitter, but have decided to do so on here too so that I can delve into more detail!  
I'm already up to day 17 (my favourite number!) so will continue from there onwards...  

**Day 17**  

Today I returned to the hackathon from Day 9 at school of code.  
We used an API to retrieve trivia questions, and create a simple quiz.  
Today I added a container and experimented with CSS to style it.

**Day18**

Some of our tasks today included experimenting with CSS variables, and working out how to add a 'night mode' toggle button.  
    
I've made a quick repo here to test my new skills: https://github.com/KatieClarinet/CSSVariables_ToggleDarkMode
