# 100DaysOfCode  
Journal of my 100 days of code  
  
So far I've been tracking my '100 days of code' on twitter, but have decided to do so on here too so that I can delve into more detail!  
I'm already up to day 17 (my favourite number!) so will continue from there onwards...  

**Day 17**  

Today I returned to the hackathon from Day 9 at school of code.  
We used an API to retrieve trivia questions, and create a simple quiz.  
Today I added a container and experimented with CSS to style it.

**Day 18**

Some of our tasks today included experimenting with CSS variables, and working out how to add a 'night mode' toggle button.  
    
I've made a quick repo here to test my new skills: https://github.com/KatieClarinet/CSSVariables_ToggleDarkMode

**Day 19**

I've had a real 'everything going wrong' kind of day today. I thought I'd worked out how to add some game scores to the Music Trivia game, but my code isn't working - so I shall return to this with a fresh perspective in a day or so.  
  
At SoC today we were introduced to 'Coolors' website, so I have used a premade palette to jazz up the Music Trivia game. A small accomplishment, but hopefully lots of small improvements will add up to big ones soon.

**Days 20 and 21**

Yesterday I spent the evening at brum.js meeting some of my fellow SoC bootcampers, so I didn't do any coding after classes but I had a great experience!  
  
Today was the last day of UX/UI week at SoC and we had to design a business landing page. My partner and I opted for a 60s+ dating app and spent the day planning the web content. We went through the  following stages:  
- User stories  
- User personas  
- Research questions  
- Low fidelity wireframe  
- High fidelity wireframe  
- Writing a code plan  
  
This evening I decided to code the page and here's where I've got to:

I still need to center the text in the footer boxes and tweak a few things, but it's the best CSS work I've done so far, and acheived in just a few hours so that's progress!
