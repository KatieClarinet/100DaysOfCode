# 100DaysOfCode  
Journal of my 100 days of code  
  
So far I've been tracking my '100 days of code' on twitter, but have decided to do so on here too so that I can delve into more detail!  
I'm already up to day 17 (my favourite number!) so will continue from there onwards...  

**Day 17**  

Today I returned to the hackathon from Day 9 at school of code.  
We used an API to retrieve trivia questions, and create a simple quiz.  
Today I added a container and experimented with CSS to style it.

**Day 18**

Some of our tasks today included experimenting with CSS variables, and working out how to add a 'night mode' toggle button.  
    
I've made a quick repo here to test my new skills: https://github.com/KatieClarinet/CSSVariables_ToggleDarkMode

**Day 19**

I've had a real 'everything going wrong' kind of day today. I thought I'd worked out how to add some game scores to the Music Trivia game, but my code isn't working - so I shall return to this with a fresh perspective in a day or so.  
  
At SoC today we were introduced to 'Coolors' website, so I have used a premade palette to jazz up the Music Trivia game. A small accomplishment, but hopefully lots of small improvements will add up to big ones soon.

**Days 20 and 21**

Yesterday I spent the evening at brum.js meeting some of my fellow SoC bootcampers, so I didn't do any coding after classes but I had a great experience!  
  
Today was the last day of UX/UI week at SoC and we had to design a business landing page. My partner and I opted for a 60s+ dating app and spent the day planning the web content. We went through the  following stages:  
- User stories  
- User personas  
- Research questions  
- Low fidelity wireframe  
- High fidelity wireframe  
- Writing a code plan  
  
This evening I decided to code the page and here's where I've got to:

I still need to center the text in the footer boxes and tweak a few things, but it's the best CSS work I've done so far, and acheived in just a few hours so that's progress!  
  
  **Day 22**  
  
*Weekend Soc Tasks*  
The task this weekend is to put our new UX/UI skills into practice and research, design and code a Portfolio page. I used Miro to start a basic plan, then created a survey using Google Forms which I've sent out to as many devs as I can. I'll check how many responces I have tomorrow then continue my planning based on survey responses.  

*Rock Paper Scissors Game*  
It's been really bugging me that I never fixed my RPS game so that it tracks the amount of 'wins/losses/draws'. I watched a JavaScript tutorial on YouTube on how to create the RPS game and followed along. The tutorial doesn't show how to track the score (which I realised once I got to the end of the tutorial!) but, I actually worked out how to do it anyway. So here it is (it's just html and JS, no CSS yet): [Rock Paper Scissors Game](https://github.com/KatieClarinet/RockPaperScissors)  

*Music Trivia Game*  
I went back to my Trivia Game to work on how to track the score and spent a long time playing around with various ways to increment the scores. Eventually I took a piece of paper and drew a map of where I want each function/loop/button to lead, and then drew out a map of what my code was actually doing. I realised that I had all three buttons calling the same function (oops!) and that my code was not in the right order. Happy to say this is now fixed and the game score works!

**Day 23**

I continued with the SoC weekend task. Using the data from my survey I created user stories and personas. I made an inspiration board and had a think about what I liked most: bold colours and minimalist designs! I then created low fi and high fi wireframes (the hi fi is a work in progress).  
  
  **Day 24**  
    
This morning I coded my website, copying my High Fideluty Wireframe [My Website](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/w3_recap-task-KatieClarinet)  
It's pretty simple at the moment but I will add to it once I have some projects ready.  

  At SoC today we did the W3 tests for HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I scored 77%, 88% and 88% respectively. We then had an introduction to Node and made sure we had it installed. We wrote a few functions using node rather than the browser, which was a new experience!  
  I'm currently a bit confused on how to export/import on node so will return to work on this tomorrow.  

**Day 25**

Today we used node to access the Express package and learned how to write a (very simple!) server. I don't have much to show for today's work, but I know have a much deeper understanding of how APIs work. Hopefully will build something in the next few days that I can link here.
